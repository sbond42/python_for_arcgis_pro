    "In this course, we'll be learning to extend and automate the functionality of ArcGIS Pro with the Python programming language. Programming can be an intimidating prospect if you've never done it before (or even if you have!), but it's an incredibly powerful and useful skill to have and well worth the effort it takes to learn. We'll start with a quick trip through the fundamentals of Python and work toward building a custom Script Tool. Along the way we'll learn how to use Python for a number of common ArcGIS Pro workflows. The topics we'll be covering are:\n",

Functions can have more than one argument or no arguments at all.\n",

A class is a template for creating a specific kind of object.  `str`, `float`, `list`, and `dict` are all classes. `\"Hello World\"` is an **instance** of the `str` class. Classes have **attributes** and **methods**. Attributes are the data stored in a class and methods are the things you can do with that data. They differ from functions in that you add them to the end of a variable of their associated class. This may all sound very complicated, and it is, but the important takeaway for now is that when you see something that looks like `my_string.lower()`, you're looking at a method.
